# MongoDB - Army management

In this project, we implemented MongoDB in the cloud to design a database based on the principle of how the army works and which ones are the tasks of its employees. Records are kept of employees, performing duties and tasks in the barracks according to the orders received. What will it be like jobs, depends on the rank or type of employment the employee has and the military unit in which he works.
